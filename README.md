This game takes the player on an unexpected journey from captivity to freedom. The game begins with the player waking up tied in the cargo hold, igniting a thrilling escape quest. It was inspired by a video that's not so relevant to the final game design. I was watching this video about a trip on a luxury cruise, really into the views on the sea, and then realized that I don't have the money for it. "If I do want to travel across seas on a ship, it might be more realistic for me to be captured by pirates", I thought, "Huh..." Then I decided to make this game, which I think is great because I can actually further enrich the contents with the following journey of the player after escaping from the ship. For now, it's just a simple escape game.
Apart from the escaping approach in playthrough.txt, there's another way of escaping successfully: stealing the key in the captain's cabin and opening the locked exit to get out. This way risks the chance of running into the captain (50%) and losing the game immediately.
